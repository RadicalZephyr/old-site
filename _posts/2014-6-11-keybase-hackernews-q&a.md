I started using Keybase sometime back in April. I've been interested
in doing crypto stuff for a long time, starting with using an SSH
keypair instead of a password to access the WWU CS department's
computer labs remotely instead of.

Learning more about GPG and actually figuring out how to send and
receive encrypted messages has been on my list of things to learn for
a while, but every time I had a couple spare minutes and tried to
approach it I was rebuffed by the impenetrability of the manuals for
gpg.

However, recently while thinking about who to give my remaining five
invites to, I decided to do some more research on what those more
security-savvy than I thought about Keybase.

The results were somewhat of a mixed bag.
