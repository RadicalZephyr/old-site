I started using [Keybase] sometime back in April. I've been interested
in doing crypto stuff for a long time, starting with using an SSH
keypair instead of a password to access the WWU CS department's
computer labs remotely.

Learning more about GPG and actually figuring out how to send and
receive encrypted messages has been on my list of things to learn for
a while, but every time I had a couple spare minutes and tried to
approach it I was rebuffed by the impenetrability of the manuals for
gpg.

However, recently while thinking about who to give my remaining five
invites to, I decided to do some more research on what those more
security-savvy than I thought about Keybase.

The results were somewhat of a mixed bag. In no particular order, I
read:

- http://blog.lrdesign.com/2014/03/thoughts-on-keybase-io/
- http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2014/03/19/Keybase
- https://filippo.io/on-keybase-dot-io-and-encrypted-private-key-sharing/
- http://blog.lizdenys.com/2014/03/31/refusing-to-verify-myself/

I also came across the discussion that occurred on Hacker News shortly
after Keybase first appeared. As so often happens when I stumble on to
a HN comment page, I ended up reading the whole thing. What I noticed
was that there seems to be some information from Max and Chris (the
founders of Keybase) that I hadn't run across on the Keybase website
itself.

So I volunteered myself for a public service. I extracted the parts of
the discussion that were interesting and relevant into a text
document. I tried to focus on the questions that got interesting
responses. I left out many little asides, and tangential
discussions.
