It's weird, but I feel like I've been peer pressured into starting
this blog.  Not that anyone has ever said "Geoff, you really need to
start a blog."  It just seems like the thing to do.  More importantly,
it seems like you're less legitimate as a programmer if you DON'T have
a blog.  Particularly a blog where you write about cool
programming/tech things that you've discovered or figured out.

But here's the thing.  I'm still learning much more than I'm figuring
out on my own.  So I decided I would write about the one subject that
I am actually exploring on my own - seasoning cast iron cookware.

A couple years ago when I was living in my first apartment with my
best friend Garrett, we bought some cast iron skillets.  We got them
from Lodge, because it seemed like the only company that really sold
cast iron anymore.  When we got them though, the factory seasoning was
somewhat disappointing, as was the quality of the metal itself.
